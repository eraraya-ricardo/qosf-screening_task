# QOSF QC Mentorship 2020 Screening Task

My name is Eraraya Ricardo Muten and this is my submission for Quantum Computing Mentorship Program. <br>
I chose the **Task 2** for this submission.

I provide two different alternatives of my answer. **You only need to read one of these** as I put everything in one file and they are all the same. I also put the versions of all dependencies inside. <br>
• Jupyter Notebook: Eraraya Ricardo Muten_QOSF QC Mentorship Program_Task 2.ipynb <br>
• nbviewer:  <br>
• Binder: [click here](https://hub.gke1.mybinder.org/user/eraraya-ricardo--screening_task-asa6odbv/notebooks/Task%202.ipynb)
• Google Colab: [Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xW9GRtnVs6uSqMjTu6FlOBhyVaZJvgC/view?usp=sharing)

Even though they are the same, but **I preferred my application to be judged based-on the nbviewer or Binder version** as it is cleaner and probably will have less issue in compatibility or rendering (the markdowns often fail for the Jupyter Notebook when open inside GitHub). If you want to run the code locally, you need an IBM Quantum Experience account and save the token in your device ([see here for the documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQFactory.save_account.html)).

By the way, I forgot to mention this in the application form: <br>
Even though I applied without a team, it doesn't mean I don't want to work in a team. I am willing to work either in a team or individually. If I were to be chosen for this program, I believe in QOSF judgment to make the decision whether to put me in a new team, in an existing team, or without a team.

Thanks a lot!
