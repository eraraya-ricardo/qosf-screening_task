# QOSF QC Mentorship 2020 Screening Task

My name is Eraraya Ricardo Muten and this is my submission for Quantum Computing Mentorship Program. <br>
I chose the **Task 2** for this submission.

I provide several different alternatives of my answer. **You only need to read one of these** as I put everything in one file and they are all the same. I also put the versions of all dependencies inside. <br>
• Jupyter Notebook: Eraraya Ricardo Muten_QOSF QC Mentorship Program_Task 2.ipynb <br>
• Binder: [click here](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/eraraya-ricardo--screening_task-seibrxuu/notebooks/Eraraya%20Ricardo%20Muten_QOSF%20QC%20Mentorship%20Program_Task%202.ipynb) <br>
• Google Colab: [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xW9GRtnVs6uSqMjTu6FlOBhyVaZJvgC/view?usp=sharing), and then click "Open with Google Colaboratory"

Even though they are the same, but **I preferred my application to be judged based-on the Binder or Google Colab version** as it is cleaner and probably will have less issue in compatibility or rendering (the markdowns often fail for the Jupyter Notebook when open inside GitHub). If you want to run the code locally, you need an IBM Quantum Experience account and save the token in your device ([see here for the documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQFactory.save_account.html)). You also may need to install all the dependencies and save your IBMQ token if you want to run the code in Binder or Colab (you don't need to if you just want to read it). I am sorry that I did not provide the nbviewer alternative as it has known cache issue (the version in nbviewer did not get updated even though I updated the GitHub).

I checked all of them several times already and they're all working fine. But if you find a markdown or image rendering error, missing graphs/plots, etc. (I hope not), please try out the different alternatives. Please feel free to contact me too if the problem persist via email to erarayaricardo.m@students.itb.ac.id

By the way, I forgot to mention this in the application form: <br>
Even though I applied without a team, it doesn't mean I don't want to work in a team. I am willing to work either in a team or individually. If I were to be chosen for this program, I believe in QOSF judgment to make the decision whether to put me in a new team, in an existing team, or without a team.

Thanks a lot!
