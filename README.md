# QOSF QC Mentorship 2020 Screening Task

My name is Eraraya Ricardo Muten and this is my submission for Quantum Computing Mentorship Program.
I chose the **Task 2** for this submission.

I provide several different formats of my answer. **You only need to read one of these** as I put everything in one file and they are all the same.
• Jupyter Notebook: Eraraya Ricardo Muten_QOSF QC Mentorship Program_Task 2.ipynb
• HTML: Eraraya Ricardo Muten_QOSF QC Mentorship Program_Task 2.html
• Google Colab: [Click here](https://www.google.com)
• nbviewer: [Click here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eraraya-ricardo/qosf-screening_task/blob/master/Eraraya%20Ricardo%20Muten_QOSF%20QC%20Mentorship%20Program_Task%202.ipynb)
**Note: The HTML version can't be open in GitHub as the size is too large (only 1.2 MB though), please download it and open it with your browser.**

Even though they are same, but **I prefer my application to be judged based-on the HTML or nbviewer version** as they are cleaner and probably will have less issue in compatibility or rendering.
